Miniaturized tracking devices have become nearly ubiquitous, and
resulted in an ever-increasing volume of *tracking data* in fields as
diverse as transportation, sports, ecology, music, medicine and data
science (Gudmundsson *et al.* 2012).  The movement community in R has
broadly embraced this new field, and created an entire ecosystem of 58
tracking packages that process, visualize and analyze tracking data
(Joo *et al.* 2020). This intense activity has led to the need of 1) a
modular solution to handle tracking data in R; 2) links with other
packages to streamline the use of tracking data in R. We developed the
`sftrack` package (https://github.com/mablab/sftrack), with support
from the **R Consortium** (September 2019â€“March 2020), to answer the
first point. We now request additional funding to move a step further
and create a more integrated tracking ecosystem across fields in R.

There is a critical lack of standard infrastructure to deal with
movement in R. As a matter of fact, half of the tracking packages work
in isolation, not being linked to any other tracking package (Fig.1).
We developed the package `sftrack` to fill up this gap: `sftrack`
provides central classes and basic functions to build, handle,
summarize and plot movement data. `sftrack` is part of a global
effort, to assess and structure the efforts of the tracking community
in R. For instance, we created a Tracking CRAN Task View describing
all tracking packages (updated twice a year, available at:
https://cran.r-project.org/view=Tracking).

```{r r-ecosystem, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.cap = "Network representation of the dependency between 58 tracking packages in R. Solid arrows go towards the package the others depend on. From Joo et al. 2020.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!b"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r-ecosystem-depend.png", error = FALSE)
```

After the first stage of development, completely in the open, the
`sftrack` package is now full-featured, and is ready for broad
testing. This milestone in the development of `sftrack` already
contributes solid foundations for the tracking ecosystem in R. There
is a need now to deepen the connections with other packages, and work
together with package developers for broad adoption of `sftrack`. We
thus propose an extension of the `sftrack` project aiming at reaching
the stable API of the package (i.e. version 1.0) by:

1. Working with developers of tracking packages to ensure linkage to
   `sftrack`, and enhance interoperability within the tracking
   ecosystem in R;
2. Establishing `sftrack` formally in the R ecosystem, through
   submissions to CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) and to rOpenSci
   (https://ropensci.org/).
