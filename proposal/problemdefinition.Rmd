Movement defined broadly plays a central role in fields as diverse as
transportation, sports, ecology, music, medicine and data science
(Gudmundsson *et al.* 2012). Miniaturized tracking devices have become
nearly ubiquitous, and resulted in an ever-increasing volume of
*tracking data* (Joo *et al.* 2020). The Movement community in R has
broadly embraced this new field, and created an entire ecosystem of
tracking packages, with 58 packages that process, visualize and
analyze tracking data (Joo *et al.* 2020), now available as a Tracking
CRAN Task View (https://cran.r-project.org/view=Tracking) that will be
updated twice a year).

However, there is a critical lack of standard infrastructure to deal
with movement. As a matter of fact, half of the tracking packages work
in isolation, not being linked to any other tracking package (Fig.1).
After identifying this gap in dealing with tracking data in R, we
started a long-term effort, to assess and structure the efforts of the
community with respect to movement data. In particular, with support
from the **R Consortium** (September 2019â€“March 2020), we developed
the `sftrack` package (https://github.com/mablab/sftrack) to provide
central classes and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and
plot movement data.

```{r r-ecosystem, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Network representation of the dependency between 58 tracking packages in R. Solid arrows go towards the package the others depend on. From Joo et al. 2020.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!b"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r-ecosystem-depend.png", error = FALSE)
```

The `sftrack` package, completely developed in the open, is now
full-featured, and is ready for broad testing. This stepping stone in
the development of `sftrack` already contributes solid foundations for
the tracking ecosystem in R. There is a need now to deepen the
connections with other packages, and work together with package
developers for broad adoption of `sftrack`. We thus propose an
extension of the `sftrack` project aiming at:

1. Working with developers of tracking packages to ensure linkage to
   `sftrack`, and enhance interoperability within the tracking
   ecosystem in R.
2. Establishing `sftrack` formally in the R ecosystem, through
   submissions to CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) and to rOpenSci
   (https://ropensci.org/).
