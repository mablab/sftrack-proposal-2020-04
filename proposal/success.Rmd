# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

This project will be successful if `sftrack` becomes the adopted
standard for tracking data in R, both from a user and a developer
perspective. Successful work with other tracking package developers to
integrate `sftrack` into their data flow will be the most important
outcome. If our efforts are successful, `sftrack` will become the
central package in the ecosystem of R tracking packages (i.e. provide
a central node in Fig.1).


## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

Success will be measured essentially from the adoption of the
`sftrack` package:

* From a developer perspective, the number of packages that will
  progressively rely on `sftrack` will be a direct measure of success:
  We will measure the number of packages linked to `sftrack`
  (`Depends` and `Imports`);
* From a user perspective, the number of downloads will tell us how
  popular the package becomes: We will track CRAN package download
  statistics, from the RStudio CRAN mirror.


## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Two axes for further development will be targeted after this stage
of work:

  * Continuing support to developers of R tracking packages to help
    them integrate `sftrack` classes or develop conversion tools from
    their own custom classes to `sftrack` classes;
  * Dynamic visualization of trajectories, allowing step by step
    exploration of trajectories with keyboard and mouse control (based
    on the solution provided in `rpostgisLT`, see
    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpostgisLT/vignettes/explorePgtraj.html).


## Key risks

What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] Costs

-->

Now that the `sftrack` package is feature complete, there is no
foreseen technical difficulty.  The main risk is actually linked to
successfully reaching out to other package developers. The R movement
has so far responded very positively to our invitations, and several
tracking package developers from a range of applications have already
expressed their interest in working together on the integration of
`sftrack`.

In addition, core project team members have all the expertise required
for the deliverables:

* **Submission to CRAN:** Mathieu Basille (`rpostgis`, `rpostgisLT`),
  Cl√©ment Calenge (`adehabitatMA`, `adehabitatHR`, `adehabitatHS`,
  `adehabitatLT`) and Emiel van Loon (`zoon`, `RNCEP`) all have
  experience preparing and submitting R packages to CRAN.
* **Submission to rOpenSci:** Matt Boone has recently been through the
  process for the package `refsplitr`
  (https://github.com/embruna/refsplitr), for which he was the lead
  coder. `refsplitr` is now part of rOpenSci
  (https://docs.ropensci.org/refsplitr/). As a matter of fact, Matt
  even wrote a detailed blog post about the whole review process at
  rOpenSci (https://mablab.org/post/ropensci/).
